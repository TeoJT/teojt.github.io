# About

<img src="images/face.jpg" width="200px"/>

Heya! I'm TÃ©o, and I'm a computer science graduate with a 1st class honours degree. I have had a passion for programming since I was a child, and I take interest in many areas of computing from low-level hardware to modern tech stacks.

In my spare time, I work on my personal coding projects and contribute to open-source repositories. Right now, my biggest projects are  [Timeway]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link timeway.md %}) and [Sketchio](https://github.com/TeoJT/Sketchio). In addition, I am working on a new renderer for [Processing](https://github.com/processing/processing4), and I have done volunteer work at the [CodeTheCity](https://codethecity.org/) charity.

My favourite programming language is Java as this is the language I have used most, and I have a strong understanding of its features, strengths and limitations. My other main programming languages are Python, C/C++, Javascript/Typescript, and C#. In addition, I have extensive experience with other systems such as Git/Github, Arduino, Linux, SQL, HTML/CSS, Jekyll, OpenGL, Vulkan, the Processing framework, and some foundational knowledge of full stack frameworks such as React, Angular and Webpack.

I am currently seeking any role in software development/IT that provides hands-on experience in real-world environments. If you are an employer with open positions or know of any open job offerings, please don't hesitate to drop me an email! I would be very happy to have any opportunity.

Please check out the projects shown on this website, my [Github](https://github.com/teojt){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and my [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link blog.md %}) to see everything that I'm up to!
