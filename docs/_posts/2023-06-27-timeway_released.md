Heya!

Just a quick update that my main project, Timeway, is now on Github!

[You can check out it here!](https://github.com/teojt/timeway){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

There's also a releases page so you can just directly download it and give it a whirl. Do be aware that it's *very* incomplete so there will be a ton of missing features. Other than that, have fun!

More blog posts on Timeway coming soon! Trust me, I have loads to talk about :P
