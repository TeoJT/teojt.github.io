			<p>Heya!</p>

<p>A few days ago (or a month at this point), I released version 0.0.2, followed by version 0.0.3 and 0.0.4 of Timeway which is significantly different from the first version, and has tons of new features to the point where I decided to dedicate this blog post as a guide on how to use it. If you wanna try it out, read on below!</p>

<p>This guide will be relevant for the latest version of Timeway, 0.0.4.</p>

<p>When you launch Timeway, you will be taken to the Pixel Realm; a representation of your drive’s files in a 3D world.</p>

<p>Use WASD to move, Q &amp; E to look left and right, and left click and right click to interact with file objects. If you’re on laptop and/or can’t use left/right click, I’ll explain how to change keybindings later below.</p>

<p>These are portals. They actually folders on your computer. Walk into it to enter this folder.</p>

<p>You can walk into the portal you emerge from to return to the previous directory.</p>
