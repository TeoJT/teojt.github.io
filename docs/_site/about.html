<p>Heya! I’m Téo, and I’m a computer science graduate with a 1st class honours degree. I have had a passion for programming since I was a child, and I take interest in many areas of computing from low-level hardware to modern tech stacks.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I work on my personal coding projects and contribute to open-source repositories. Right now, my biggest projects are  <a href="/timeway.html">Timeway</a> and <a href="https://github.com/TeoJT/Sketchio">Sketchio</a>. In addition, I am working on a new renderer for <a href="https://github.com/processing/processing4">Processing</a>, and I have done volunteer work at the <a href="https://codethecity.org/">CodeTheCity</a> charity.</p>

<p>My favourite programming language is Java as this is the language I have used most, and I have a strong understanding of its features, strengths and limitations. My other main programming languages are Python, C/C++, Javascript/Typescript, and C#. In addition, I have extensive experience with other systems such as Git/Github, Arduino, Linux, SQL, HTML/CSS, Jekyll, OpenGL, Vulkan, the Processing framework, and some foundational knowledge of full stack frameworks such as React, Angular and Webpack.</p>

<p>I am currently seeking any role in software development/IT that provides hands-on experience in real-world environments. If you are an employer with open positions or know of any open job offerings, please don’t hesitate to drop me an email! I would be very happy to have any opportunity.</p>

<p>Please check out the projects shown on this website, my <a href="https://github.com/teojt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>, and my <a href="/blog.html">blog</a> to see everything that I’m up to!</p>
