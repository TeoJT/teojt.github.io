<h3>Terminal calendar</h3>
<p>A Python command-line tool for Linux which displays a coloured calendar and displays scheduled events. This project was created to learn about Python programming back in my 2nd year semester 1 of university.</p>

<h3>Terminal display</h3>
<p>A C program which displays pixels in the terminal. It does this by utilising the foreground and background colours of characters in the Linux terminal. This was created as part of my <a href="https://github.com/TeoJT/my-3d-engine">3D engine from scratch</a> project. It also includes a few demos.</p>

<h3>Leader Izz</h3>
<p>A game for the Games Programming course in 4th year of university. In this game, you control a masked character called Izz as she navigates the level and collects spirits without taking any hits. This project was made in Unity.</p>

<h3>Wrist Cluster</h3>
<p>An electronics project where I make my own smartwatch using the BBC Micro:bit, using the low-level hardware for maximum capabilities in C++. This project is also where I learned C++'s object orientated programming.</p>
<p>Blog entry and Github repo coming soon!</p>

<h3>Sketchiepad</h3>
<p>A rudimentary tool/framework for making animations with code within Processing. This effectively did a number of workload-reducing stuff such as loading images automatically, syncing music with the animation, and moving/scaling sprites. This has helped me to earn over Â£300 through online comissions. This has now been superceded by <a href="https://github.com/TeoJT/Sketchio">Sketchio</a>.</p>

<h3>Shaders</h3>
<p>A collection of my shaders on ShaderToy.</p>

<h3>Graphics Programming coursework</h3>
<p>University coursework which involved 3 stages; creating 3D models with Blender, creating a 3D animation with Unreal Engine, and creating an interactive demo with OpenGL. The animation can be <a href="./images/FinalRenderCompressed.mp4">viewed here</a>.</p>

<h3>C & ARM Assembly coursework</h3>
<p>In this university coursework, the task was to assemble a circuit with a Raspberry Pi and write low-level code to access the hardware using C and Assembly, the later being the language I programmed. This coursework involved logical programming of low-level ARM assembly and strengthened my knowledge of hardware.
