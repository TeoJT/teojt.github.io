    <p2>Welcome to this guide on starbits!</p2>
    <p><u>Overview</u></p>
    <p>Starbits describes <strong>how stable you are in terms of studying</strong> and the amount of work you've done.
    </p>
    <p>At the start of each day, <strong>50✦</strong> will be deducted from your total, and can go negative if you've got less than 50✦. If you're in the negative zone, you will <strong>NOT</strong> be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Discord</li>
        <li>Go on Pony Town</li>
        <li>Use Twitter</li>
        <li>Make music</li>
        <li>And another thing I'm not going to mention here because... reasons...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should use Cold Turkey to block any of these when you're negative. However at the start of each day if you're in the negative zone, you can have a grace period of about 10 minutes before you put on the Cold Turkey block and close Discord.</p>
    
    <p>Should you remove starbits if you break any of the rules? No! No need for any punishment. Go look at Twitter while you're in the negative zone if ya wish, but remember that by playing by the rules, you are making all effort put into this game worth it. If you're on Discord for a bit when you're not meant to, not the end of the world, as long as you aren't on it all day while negative.</p>

    <br>
    <p><u>Earning Starbits</u></p>
    <p>Now on to the fun part: Starbits are earned manually so it's up to you to determine how many starbits you can get. But of course, to do that we need to lay some rules. These rules can be changed at any time.</p>

    <div style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
        <ul style="white-space: pre-line;">
            <li><strong>After</strong> you complete a paper/series of questions, you will get rewarded 5✦ for every correct question, sub question or full question.</li>
            <li>When marking past exam papers, starbits are rewarded Marks are Magic style. 1 mark = 1✦ for a paper you haven't attempted before.</li>
            <li>Watching a tutorial video (lectures not included) and understanding the content will give 1 starbit per minute in the video. A 14:34 video will give you 14✦.
            </li>
            <li>Attending a lecture is worth 5✦.</li>
            <li>Getting help from a person in a tutorial session is worth 23✦</li>
            <li>An hour spent working on a personal hobby/project* is worth 12✦, whether the perpose is to learn or not.</li>
            <li>An hour on working on work relavent to university work (preparing for a test, etc) is worth 22✦</li>
            <li>Completing coursework (group coursework or solo) or a test is worth 20✦.</li>
            <li>The marks you recieve on the coursework can also reward you starbits. To calculate how much starbits you deserve, take your test score percentage as a whole number, and then multiply it by the percentage of the total marks the test contributes to. If the coursework/test was solo work (no groupwork), then multiply your reward by 2. <br>Example: 86% on a test done by yourself, marks is worth 30% of the course, 86*0.30*2=50✦.
            </li>
            <li>A driving practice session is worth 18✦. Only one reward of such per day.</li>
            <li>Like always, you'll get rewarded 20✦ if you go to bed before 10pm, 10✦ before 11pm, and. You must turn off your laptop BEFORE these times. One minute after and the reward is voided.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <br>

    <tiny2>*a hobby/project isn't limited to just pure coding: it can be any other activity where you're productive. Here is some concrete examples: <ul>
        <li>Typing stuff in HTML (and hence not really programming)</li>
        <li>Making music (even though it's banned if you're negative)</li>
        <li>Learning new stuff, even if it's not directly related to programming</li>
    </ul></tiny2>

    <p>For timed stuff (e.g. 5✦ for an hour of this), it does not need to be so specific. However, you shouldn't round to the largest hour (e.g. if you do coding for 1 hour 40 minutes and consider it 2). You can half starbit numbers if you feel like it, but only if you know you've put some extra work that doesn't quite meet the requirements mentioned above. You should also in general floor your estimated numbers as we all know that working for 1 hour does not mean 1 hour of 100% concentration.</p>


    <p>That's about all the rules for now. Don't forget to update them when things change or you're not getting the reward you deserve! (or you're rewarding yourself too much but I don't want you to be mean on yourself because this isn't <asdf style="color:red">Red Starbits</asdf>).</p>
    <tiny2>(Just wanted to also add: this isn't Marks are Magic either; we're not in a serious exam situation, so there's no need to reward yourself a tiny amount of starbits.)</tiny2>
